what are the html tags ?

-> HTML tags are the building blocks of a webpage, used to define the structure and content of a document. They are represented by a less-than symbol (<) followed by a tag name, and ended with a greater-than symbol (>). Most HTML tags come in pairs, with the opening tag preceding the content and the closing tag following the content.

There are the paired tags and single tag

<head></head>: Contains metadata about the document
<body></body>: Contains the content of the HTML document
<ul></ul>: Defines an unordered list
<li></li>: Defines a list item
<img></img>: Embeds an image

unpaired tag
