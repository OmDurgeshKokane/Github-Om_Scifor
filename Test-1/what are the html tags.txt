what are the html tags ?
In HTML, tags are used to define elements and structure content on a web page. There are two types of HTML tags: paired tags and unpaired tags.

Paired Tags

Paired tags, also known as container tags, consist of an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag is used to start the element, and the closing tag is used to end the element. The content of the element is placed between the opening and closing tags.

Headings: <h1>Heading</h1>, <h2>Subheading</h2>, ...
Paragraphs: <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
Links: <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
Images: <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image on the page">

Unpaired tags, also known as empty tags, do not have a closing tag. They are used to add a single element to a web page, such as an image or a line break.

Here are some examples of unpaired HTML tags:

Line Break: <br>
Horizontal Rule: <hr>
Image: <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image on the page"> (note: while images can have a closing tag, it is not required)
